# Blog Post Title Suggestion API — Single File Django App

This project is a minimal Django API built in **one Python file** that suggests blog post titles using OpenAI’s GPT model.

---

## Features

- Simple API endpoint `/suggest-titles/` accepts POST requests with blog content.
- Returns 3 suggested blog post titles generated by OpenAI.
- Entire app is contained in a single Python file for easy setup and testing.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher installed
- OpenAI API key (Get it here: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
- Basic knowledge of command line / terminal

---

## Step-by-step setup and usage

1.  **Create and activate a Python virtual environment (recommended)**

    ```bash
    # Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate virtual environment:
    # On Windows PowerShell:
    venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  **Install required Python packages**

    ```bash
    pip install django openai
    ```

3.  **Create your Django app in a single Python file**

    Create a file named `manage.py`.

    Paste your Django + OpenAI integration code into it. This file should contain:

    * Django setup and configuration
    * URL routing for `/suggest-titles/`
    * A view function that:
        * Accepts POST requests with JSON containing "content"
        * Calls OpenAI API with your API key from environment variable
        * Returns a JSON response with 3 suggested titles

4.  **Set your OpenAI API key environment variable**

    Your app reads the OpenAI API key from the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`. Set it as follows:

    * On Windows PowerShell:

        ```powershell
        $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-YourOpenAIKeyHere"
        ```

    * On macOS/Linux terminal:

        ```bash
        export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-YourOpenAIKeyHere"
        ```

    Replace `"sk-YourOpenAIKeyHere"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

5.  **Run the Django development server**

    Start your app with:

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

    You should see:

    ```
    Starting development server at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
    ```

6.  **Test the API endpoint `/suggest-titles/`**

    You can test with:

    a) `curl` (Linux/macOS/Windows WSL)

    ```bash
    curl -X POST [http://127.0.0.1:8000/suggest-titles/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/suggest-titles/) \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d "{\"content\": \"Your blog post content goes here.\"}"
    ```

    b) Postman

    * **Method**: `POST`
    * **URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/suggest-titles/`
    * **Headers**: `Content-Type: application/json`
    * **Body** (raw JSON):

        ```json
        {
          "content": "Your blog post content goes here."
        }
        ```

    Send the request and you should receive JSON with suggested titles.

### Example JSON response

```json
{
  "suggested_titles": [
    "How AI is Transforming Marketing Strategies",
    "The Future of Marketing with Generative AI",
    "Boost Your Brand with AI-Powered Marketing"
  ]
}
